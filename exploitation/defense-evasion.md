### Anti-Virus Detection Methods

* **Signature scanning** scans files for known virus signatures. If a file contains a signature that matches a known virus, the file will be quarantined or deleted.
* **Heuristic scanning** analyzes files for suspicious behavior that may indicate a virus. For example, heuristic scanning might look for files that try to modify the system registry or other important system files.
* **Behavioral monitoring** tracks the behavior of programs as they run. If a program behaves in a way that suggests it is a virus, the program will be quarantined or deleted.

### Anti-Virus Evasion Techniques

#### 1-) On-Disk Evasion

On-disk evasion techniques are used by malware to avoid detection by anti-virus software that relies on scanning files stored on disk. These techniques allow malware to remain hidden in the file system of a compromised system, making it difficult for traditional anti-virus solutions to detect and remove them.

Some common on-disk evasion techniques include:

1. Encryption: Malware may encrypt itself to make it difficult for anti-virus software to identify its signature. This technique involves using encryption algorithms to scramble the code of the malware, making it appear as a benign file.
2. Obfuscation: This technique involves altering the code of the malware to make it difficult for anti-virus software to identify its signature. This can include changing variable names, adding junk code, or using code obfuscation tools.

#### 2-) In-Memory Evasion

In-memory evasion is a technique used by malware to avoid detection by anti-virus software. This technique involves running the malware in memory, rather than on disk. This makes it difficult for anti-virus software to detect the malware, because it is not stored on disk and cannot be scanned.
